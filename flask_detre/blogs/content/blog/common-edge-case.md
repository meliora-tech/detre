You are busy cleaning your dataset which has about 50000 rows and your manager sends an email, "Hi, Can you get the
dates from the comment column as well? Thanks" You take a look at the column and find that the dates don't have a

Such a request is common that there should be a button one click which produces reasonable results. In the table,
